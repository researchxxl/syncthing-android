### Workaround to address 'welcome screen repeatedly shown'

Xiaomi MIUI's battery saver system app revokes the app's 'ignore battery optimization' permission on every phone reboot. This causes the app to show the welcome screen and ask for the missing mandatory permission again.

Solution: From home screen, open the app drawer, long press 'Syncthing-Fork' > 'App info' > 'Battery saver' and select 'No restrictions' (MIUI 10.3.2.0+).
