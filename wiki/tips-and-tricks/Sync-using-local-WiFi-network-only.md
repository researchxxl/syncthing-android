### Sync using local WiFi network or hotspot only

If you'd like to sync only with devices that are located on the local WiFi network or reachable via WiFi hotspot, you can lower battery usage and avoid accidentially syncing over mobile data by turning off the following options under 'Settings/Syncthing Options':

* NAT traversal
* Global Discovery
* Relaying

Only leave 'Local discovery' enabled.
