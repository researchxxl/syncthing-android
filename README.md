# Syncthing for Android


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Syncthing-Fork was previously developed and maintained by [Catfriend1](https://github.com/catfriend1). As they seem to no longer be actively maintaining the project, I will continue the full development and maintenance here going forward. Thank you Catfriend1 for building and sharing this amazing project and all the effort you put into keeping Syncthing available on Android!

A wrapper of [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) for Android. 

As the project is currently in the middle of a migration, the recommended and most stable installation method is the [Play Store channel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid). APKs for manual installations or through Obtainium are available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/nel0x/syncthing-android/releases).
The setup of a F-Droid repository is currently in work.
